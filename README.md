### [Deployed Project](http://smartdictionary.vercel.app/)

## Overview
The Smart Dictionary was built with Worlink API! The goal of this project was to develop a React application with a way for users to search and interact with words of interest via the learning page! A user-friendly navigation system will guide them where they need to go at the click of a button. A server-side error handling feature was added, as well as a user error handling feature.

## Project Context
I am a deloper in the Front-End Program at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://frontend.turing.edu/), which means we have been devs for 5 months! Smart Dictionart one of many prjects I have worked on.

Learning Goals for this project included:      
✔️ Use at least one external API      
✔️ extend my knodge on React Context             
✔️ Create a multi-page engaging UX using React Router
